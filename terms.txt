DISCLAIMERS
For the best user experience please use the program in full screen mode and ensure that the system scale is set to 100%.

If a date range is inputted before the IPO of a given security, the date will still display, however, the data will be taken from the initial public offering until the selected end date.

To query a specific time range, the user must enter the start date and end date and click the apply time range button.

When a new stock is queried, the maximum time range for that stock will be displayed.

If a queried start date is beyond the end date, the system will remain unchanged.
